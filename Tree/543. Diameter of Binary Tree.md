# Question
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Example 1:

```bash
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```
Example 2:

```bash
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```
# Answer
首先我们要明白什么叫树的直径：
已知一条路径的长度为该路径经过的节点数-1，所以直径(路径长度的最大值)等效于求该路径经过节点数的最大值-1。
任意一条路径均可看作由某个节点为起点，从其左子树和右子树向下遍历的路径拼接得到。

 如图我们可以知道路径 [9,4,2,5,7,8] 可以看作以 2 为起点，从其左子树向下遍历的路径 [2,4,9] 和其右子树向下遍历的路径 [2,5,7,8] 拼接得到
