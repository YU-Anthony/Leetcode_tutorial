# Question
Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Example 1:

```bash
Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/btree.jpg)
```bash
Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation: [1,3] and [3,1] are both a height-balanced BSTs.
```
# Answer
这道题解题的本质不在于二叉“搜索”树和中序遍历，本质是“平衡”而已。实现二叉树的平衡其实很简单。每次把一组数中间的位置作为树的头拎起来，剩下部分平均分成两份就行。
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        def makeTree(left,right):
            if left > right:
                return None
            mid = (left+right)//2
            root = TreeNode(nums[mid]) # 做一个小树的 root
            root.left = makeTree(left,mid-1) # 做左子树
            root.right = makeTree(mid+1,right) # 做右子树
            # 返回树
            return root
        return makeTree(0,len(nums)-1)
```
