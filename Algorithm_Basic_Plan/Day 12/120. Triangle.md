# Question
Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.

For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.

Example 1:
```bash
Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
Output: 11
Explanation: The triangle looks like:
   2
  3 4
 6 5 7
4 1 8 3
The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).
```

Example 2:
```bash
Input: triangle = [[-10]]
Output: -10
```

# Answer

思路：动态规划，自上而下
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        # 自上到下
        for i in range(1,len(triangle)):
            for j in range(len(triangle[i])):
                if j ==0: triangle[i][j] +=triangle[i-1][j]
                elif j == len(triangle[i])-1: triangle[i][j] +=triangle[i-1][j-1]
                else: triangle[i][j]+=min(triangle[i-1][j-1],triangle[i-1][j])

        return min(triangle[-1])
```
