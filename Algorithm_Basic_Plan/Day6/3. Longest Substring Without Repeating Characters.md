# Question
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
```bash
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

Example 2:
```bash
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

Example 3:
```bash
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = []
        max_len = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            while s[i] in res:
                del res[0]
            res.append(s[i])
            max_len = max(max_len,len(res))
        return max_len
```
