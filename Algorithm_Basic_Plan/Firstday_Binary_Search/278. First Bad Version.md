# Question
You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example 1:

```bash
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```
Example 2:
```bash
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
```

# Answer
这里要注意下端点值的变化
```python
# @param version, an integer
# @return an integer
# def isBadVersion(version):

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        left = 1
        right = n
        while left <right:
            ## 防止平均值溢出
            # mid = left+(right-left)//2
            mid = (left+right)//2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid+1
        # 返回右端点的原因是 bad version 都在右边区间
        return right
```
