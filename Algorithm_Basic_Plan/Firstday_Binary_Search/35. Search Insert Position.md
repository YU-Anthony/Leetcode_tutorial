# Question
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# Answer
注意 while 的条件，如果选择 <= 则 `left = mid+1` `right = mid-1`
```python
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums)-1

        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right-left)//2
            if target>nums[mid]:
                left = mid+1
            elif target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid-1
            else:
                return mid
        return left
```
