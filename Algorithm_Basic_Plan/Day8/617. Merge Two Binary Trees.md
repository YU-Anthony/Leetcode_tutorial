# Question
You are given two binary trees root1 and root2.

Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

Return the merged tree.

Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

Example 1:

```bash
Input: root1 = [1,3,2,5], root2 = [2,1,3,null,4,null,7]
Output: [3,4,5,5,4,null,7]
```

Example 2:
```bash
Input: root1 = [1], root2 = [1,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

# Answer
看到这道题，我在想不就是把各个节点的值加起来嘛哈哈哈哈。当然，在数组中这种很好实现，但在树这个结构中也不难，我们只需要前序遍历(中->左->右)整棵树就行。

思路一：递归，深度优先

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, root1: TreeNode, root2: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        def DFS(r1,r2):
            if not r1 or not r2:
                return r1 if not r2 else r2

            r1.val+=r2.val
            r1.left = DFS(r1.left,r2.left)
            r1.right = DFS(r1.right,r2.right)
            return r1
```
