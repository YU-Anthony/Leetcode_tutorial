```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        rule = {'{': '}',  '[': ']', '(': ')','?':'?'}

        stack = ['?']
        for i in s:
            if i in rule:
                stack.append(i)
            elif i != rule[stack.pop()]:
                return False
        return len(stack)==1
