# Question
Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example 1
```
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.
```
Example 2
```
Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring is "aa" with length 2.
```

# Answer
This is a variation of problem `159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters`.
Solution1. Sliding window + HashTable. We just need to change `2` to `k`.
```python3
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        l=ret=0
        res=defaultdict(int)
        cnt=0
        for r, val in enumerate(s):
            res[val]+=1
            if len(res)<=k:
                ret=max(ret,r-l+1)
            while len(res)>k:
                res[s[l]]-=1
                if res[s[l]]==0:
                    del res[s[l]]
                l+=1
        return ret
```
