# Problem
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
- Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

Example 1
```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

Example 2
```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

Constraints
- n == ratings.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
- 0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

# Answer
运用贪心算法，
- 先从后往前遍历一次确定左孩子大于右孩子的情况
- 再从前往后遍历一次确定右孩子大于左孩子的情况
```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, R):
        n = len(R)
        ans = [1]*n
        
        for j in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if R[j] > R[j + 1]:
                ans[j] = ans[j + 1] + 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if R[i] > R[i - 1]:
                ans[i] = max(ans[i], ans[i - 1] + 1)
        return sum(ans)
```
