# Question
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Note:

Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. -3.

Example 1:
```bash
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```
Example 2:
```bash
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

# Answer

## Solution 1: 位数右移
最直观的想法还是判断二进制的每一位数是否为1，具体做法是：
1. n & 1, 如果最后一位为1则返回1
2. n 右移一位直至结束
```python3
class Solution(object):
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        res = 0
        while n:
            res += n & 1
            n >>= 1
        return res
```
- TC: O(k), k 为 n 的二进制长度
- SC: O(1)

## Solution 2: n & (n - 1)
主要要掌握 n&(n-1) 能够消除最低位的1

原理如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while n:
            res += 1
            n = n & (n - 1)
        return res
```

- TC: O(k), k 为 n 的二进制长度
- SC: O(1)
