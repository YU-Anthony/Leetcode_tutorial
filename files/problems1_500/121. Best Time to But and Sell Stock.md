## Problem
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Example
```bash
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

## Solution
### Solution 1: 一次遍历

We could go through each price and use `minPrice` to track previous lowest price and `maxProfift` to track max profit we have achived so far
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        minPrice = int(1e9)
        maxProfit = 0
        for price in prices:
            minPrice = min(minPrice,price)
            maxProfit = max(price-minPrice,maxProfit)
            
        return maxProfit
```

- SC: O(1)

### Solution 2: Dynamic Programming

Step 1: 定义状态

定义状态 `dp[i]` 表示到下标为 i 这一天我们获得的最大收益

Step 2: 确定状态转移方程
```
dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], prices[i] - minprice)
```
第 i 天的最大收益需要比较前 i-1 天的最大收益和第 i 天的收益。

Step 3: 确定初始值
```
dp[0] = 0 
minPrice = prices[0]
```
第一天还没有交易, 所以我们的收益为 0


```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        minPrice = prices[0]
        
        dp = [0]*len(prices)
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i])
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], prices[i] - minPrice)
        return dp[-1]
```
