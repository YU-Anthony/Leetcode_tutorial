We can use the typical DFS approach. The additional thing we need to do is to keep track of the number representing the current path. 
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        allPaths = []
        
        def helper(node, allPaths, pathSum):
            if not node:
                return
            pathSum = pathSum * 10 + node.val
            
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                allPaths.append(pathSum)
            else:
                helper(node.left, allPaths, pathSum)
                helper(node.right, allPaths, pathSum)
            pathSum /= 10
        
        helper(root, allPaths, 0)
        return sum(allPaths)
```
- TC: O(N), N is the number of nodes. We need to traverse all nodes
- SC: O(N), this space will be used to store the recrusion stack. The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list(e.g, each node has just one child).
