# Problem
Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/partition.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
```

Example 2
```
Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

Constaints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- -200 <= x <= 200
# Answer
前面我们做过了合并链表，今天这道题的思想则是`分解链表`。

具体来说就是将原链表分成两个小链表，一个链表的元素都小于x,另一个链表的元素都大于等于x,最后将两个链表合并起来。但要注意`虚拟头节点`的运用。

All we need to do is to create two dummy nodes and then go through origin list and add elements. On each step we check if the value `<` or `>=` x and then add to different lists. After traverse all nodes, we get two lists like this `dummyA ->..... -> currA`, `dummyB ->..... -> currB`. So we need to add connection `currA -> dummyB`, and then return `dummyA.next`
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: Optional[ListNode], x: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummyA = ListNode(0)
        dummyB = ListNode(0)
        currA, currB = dummyA, dummyB
        curr = head
        
        while curr:
            if curr.val < x:
                currA.next = curr
                currA = currA.next
            else:
                currB.next = curr
                currB = currB.next
            tmp = curr.next
            curr.next = None
            curr = tmp
        currA.next = dummyB.next
        return dummyA.next
```
