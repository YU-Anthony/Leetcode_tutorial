```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) <= 2:
            return len(nums)
        slow = 2
        for fast in range(2, len(nums)):
            if nums[fast] != nums[slow - 2]:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast]
                slow += 1
        return slow
```
- TC: O(n)
- SC: O(1)
We could use two pointers method, slow means the current position where we should put the element. As each unique element appears at most twice, so each time we should compare nums[fast] with nums[slow - 2]. If nums[fast] != nums[slow - 2], then we could put nums[fast] to the position slow.
