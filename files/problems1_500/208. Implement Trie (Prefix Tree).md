# Problem
A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

- Trie() Initializes the trie object.
- void insert(String word) Inserts the string word into the trie.
- boolean search(String word) Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
- boolean startsWith(String prefix) Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.

Example 1
```
Input
["Trie", "insert", "search", "search", "startsWith", "insert", "search"]
[[], ["apple"], ["apple"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"], ["app"]]
Output
[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]

Explanation
Trie trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
trie.search("apple");   // return True
trie.search("app");     // return False
trie.startsWith("app"); // return True
trie.insert("app");
trie.search("app");     // return True
```

Constraints
- 1 <= word.length, prefix.length <= 2000
- word and prefix consist only of lowercase English letters.
- At most 3 * 104 calls in total will be made to insert, search, and startsWith.

Firstly, we are going to define a TrieNode which have two fields.

We have a `children` field. This is a hashmap. Each node will contain a hashmap of children

We also have a `endOfword` property. This is boolean. We will use this to determine we have reached the end of word. So when we insert a word, we will set `endOfword` property to `True` on the last node.

- For insertion, we serach the word character by character. We then ask the current node `"Do you have a child with that character ?"`. If so, we move to it. Otherwise, we create a new node and add it to the children. Once we have reached the end of word, we set `endOfword` to `True`.
- For seaching, we serach the word character by character. We then ask the current node `"Do you have a child with that character ?"`. If so, we move to it. Otherwise, we return False. Once we have reached the end of the word, we need to check the `endOfword` property of that node.
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.endOfword = False
class Trie:

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        cur = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in cur.children:
                cur.children[c] = TrieNode()
            cur = cur.children[c]
        cur.endOfword = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        cur = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in cur.children:
                return False
            cur = cur.children[c]
        return cur.endOfword
        

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        cur = self.root
        for c in prefix:
            if c not in cur.children:
                return False
            cur = cur.children[c]
        return True
        


# Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Trie()
# obj.insert(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
# param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)
```
- TC：初始化为 O(1)，其余操作为 O(|S|)，其中 |S|是每次插入或查询的字符串的长度。
- SC：O(∣T∣⋅Σ)，其中 |T|为所有插入字符串的长度之和，Σ 为字符集的大小，本题 Σ=26
