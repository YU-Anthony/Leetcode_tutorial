# Question
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
```bash
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```
Example 2:
```bash
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

# Answer
双指针，很简单，不赘述
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        left,right = 0,len(s)-1

        while left<=right:
            temp = s[right]
            s[right]=s[left]
            s[left] = temp
            left+=1
            right-=1
```
