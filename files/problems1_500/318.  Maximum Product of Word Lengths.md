# Problem
Given a string array words, return the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

Example 1
```bash
Input: words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
```

Example 2
```bash
Input: words = ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
```

Example 3
```bash
Input: words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: 0
Explanation: No such pair of words.
```

Constraints
- 2 <= words.length <= 1000
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 1000
- words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

# Answer
We can use the fact that each word has only letters from `a` to `z`. Let `d[word]` be the bitmask of each word. For example, for word `aaabe` we will have mask `...10011`.
So the whole algorithm can be seperated into two stages:
1. Computer all mask for all words, we will use `d[word] |= 1 << (ord(l) - 97)`, where `97` is code if symbol `a`. Also, we use `|` to update zero-elements, but if we already have one element, they will not change.
2. For every pair of words check if `d[w1] & d[w2] == 0`, this is the condiation that pairs of words will not have any intersections. Then, update `ans` 

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, words):
        d, ans = defaultdict(int), 0
        for word in words:
            for l in word:
                d[word] |= 1<<(ord(l) - 97)
        
        for w1 in d:
            for w2 in d:
                if d[w1] & d[w2] == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, len(w1)*len(w2))
        return ans
        
```
