# Question

Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg)
```bash
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
```

Example 2:
```bash
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```

# Answer

`岛屿问题`. In this problem, we should figure out what exactly surrended by `X` means. If we satrt from `O` at the boarder, and we travers only `O`s, only those `O`s are not surrouned by `X`. So, here is our plan:
- Start dfs/bfs from all `O`s on the border
- When we traverse them, let us color them as `T` (temporary color)
- After we traverse all we wanted, the left `O`s are all `O`s that are surrouned by `X`. Therefore, we should change the left `O` to `X`, and change all `T` to `O`. That is all!

### Solution 1: DFS
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        方法一：
        从边界找起，找到那些不符合替换条件的 O 并先把他们变为 A
        然后遍历整个 board, 填充剩余的 O 并替换 A 为 O
        """
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        def dfs(x, y):
            if 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and board[x][y] == "O":
                board[x][y] = "#"
                for choice in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                    nx = x + choice[0]
                    ny = y + choice[1]
                    dfs(nx, ny)
        
        # 第一列和最后一列
        for i in range(m):
            dfs(i, 0)
            dfs(i, n - 1)
        # 第一行和最后一行
        for j in range(n):
            dfs(0, j)
            dfs(m - 1, j)
        # print(board)
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                board[i][j] = "O" if board[i][j] == "#" else "X"
```

- TC: O(m * n)
- SC: O(m * n)

### Solution 2: BFS
```python
class Solution:
    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        def bfs(x, y):
            queue = [(x, y)]
            while queue:
                q = queue.pop(0)
                if 0 <= q[0] < m and 0 <= q[1] < n and board[q[0]][q[1]] == "O":
                    board[q[0]][q[1]] = "#"
                    for choice in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                        nx = q[0] + choice[0]
                        ny = q[1] + choice[1]
                        queue.append((nx, ny))
        
        for i in range(m):
        # 搜索第一行和最后一行
            bfs(i, 0)
            bfs(i, n - 1)
        
        for i in range(n):
        # 搜索第一列和最后一列
            bfs(0, i)
            bfs(m - 1, i)
        # print(board)
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                board[i][j] = "O" if board[i][j] == "#" else "X"
