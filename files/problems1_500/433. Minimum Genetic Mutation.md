这道题简直跟 `127. Word Ladder` 一摸一样, we can call this problem `Gene Ladder`!

We can convert these gene strings to a graph, where two nodes have a edge if they differ by a character. So, this problem can be seen as to find the shortest path from `start` gene to `end` gene. In this situation, BFS would be a great solution as we always visited all nodes at distance `x` from `start` before any nodes at distance `x + 1`. As a result of this, when we reach `end` node, we find the shortest path.

The steps are as follow:
1. Keep track of the number of steps taken so far and return the number of steps when we reach `end`.
2. Only travere nodes that are in `bank`
3. Neighbors can be found by iterate over each node and replace one of characters with a character of from `ACGT`.

```python
class Solution:
    def minMutation(self, start: str, end: str, bank: List[str]) -> int:
        queue = deque()
        queue.append((start, 0))
        visited = set()
        
        while queue:
            gene, step = queue.popleft()
            if gene == end:
                return step
            for i in range(len(gene)):
                for c in "ACGT":
                    new_gene = gene[:i] + c + gene[i+1:]
                    if new_gene in bank and new_gene not in visited:
                        queue.append((new_gene, step + 1))
                        visited.add(new_gene)
        return -1
```
- TC: O(N), the length of bank
- SC: O(N), the length of bank
