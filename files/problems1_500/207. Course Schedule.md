# Problem
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

- For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

Example 2
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```
# Answer
This is a classical problem about `topological sort`. The main idea is to check if there is any cycle exists in the graph. If there is, we need to return `False`.

So the solution is to use `dfs` traversal, we keep track of all the courses along with path by using a visited set. 
- If there is a course visited, we find a cycle, so we just need to return False. 
- If the prerequisites of a course happened to be `[]`, it means this course have no prerequisites and it can be definitely completed.
- If neither of above conditions meet, we add the current course to the visited set and keep use `dfs` for the prerequisites. 
- Just remember to remove the node from visited set after we finish the DFS. Because we don't need to do `dfs` twice on the same node.

As the graph is not necessarily connected, we need to do `dfs` for all nodes.


```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # map each course to prerequisites list
        preMap = {i : [] for i in range(numCourses)}
        for crs, pre in prerequisites:
            preMap[crs].append(pre)
        
        # visitSet = all the courses along with the current path
        visitSet = set()
        
        def dfs(crs):
            if crs in visitSet: # detected a loop
                return False
            if preMap[crs] == []:
                return True
            
            visitSet.add(crs)
            for pre in preMap[crs]:
                if not dfs(pre): return False
            visitSet.remove(crs)
            preMap[crs] = []
            
            return True
        
        for crs in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(crs):
                return False
        return True
```
- TC: O(E+V), where E is number of edges and V is number of vertices.
- SC: O(E+V), because we used adjacency lists

## BFS Topological
首先构造一个 graph 来表示前置课与当前课的关系

然后想一下我们最先上的课肯定就是没有前置课的课对吧，所以我们遍历的找出所有没有前置课(入度为1)的课放入 queue 中

对于 queue 中的每一个课 v，我们去找能上的下一门课 u，u 的条件是以 v 为前置课，且当上完课 u 之后， v 的入度就为 0 了，也就是我们在遍历 v 的后置课程时要再次将入度为1的所有课加入 queue 中。记住每一步要更新迄今为止上的课的数量。

最后比较我们记录的课与实际应该上的课是否符合，如果不符，说明我们不能找到一条顺序来上完所有的课

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        res = {i : [] for i in range(numCourses)}
        indegree = [0] * numCourses
        for u, v in prerequisites:
            res[v].append(u)
            indegree[u] += 1
            
        queue = deque()
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if indegree[i] == 0:
                queue.append(i)
        
        cnt = 0
        while queue:
            course = queue.popleft()
            cnt += 1
            for child in res[course]:
                indegree[child] -= 1
                if indegree[child] == 0:
                    queue.append(child)
        return cnt == numCourses
```
