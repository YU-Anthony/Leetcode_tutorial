# Problem
# Answer
This is a classical problem about `topological sort`. The main idea is to check if there is any cycle exists in the graph. If there is, we need to return `False`.

So the solution is to use `dfs` traversal, we keep track of all the courses along with path by using a visited set. 
- If there is a course visited, we find a cycle, so we just need to return False. 
- If the prerequisites of a course happened to be `[]`, it means this course have no prerequisites and it can be definitely completed.
- If neither of above conditions meet, we add the current course to the visited set and keep use `dfs` for the prerequisites. 
- Just remember to remove the node from visited set after we finish the DFS. So we don't need to do `dfs` twice on the same node.

As the graph is not necessarily connected, we need to do `dfs` for all nodes.


```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        # map each course to prerequisites list
        preMap = {i : [] for i in range(numCourses)}
        for crs, pre in prerequisites:
            preMap[crs].append(pre)
        
        # visitSet = all the courses along with the current path
        visitSet = set()
        
        def dfs(crs):
            if crs in visitSet: # detected a loop
                return False
            if preMap[crs] == []:
                return True
            
            visitSet.add(crs)
            for pre in preMap[crs]:
                if not dfs(pre): return False
            visitSet.remove(crs)
            preMap[crs] = []
            
            return True
        
        for crs in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(crs):
                return False
        return True

- TC: O(E+V), where E is number of edges and V is number of vertices.
- SC: O(E+V), because we used adjacency lists
