# Problem
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1
```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

Example 2
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```
# Answer
### Vote Algorithm
该问题可以使用摩尔投票算法（Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm）来解决。
Since the number of majority element will be at least  n // 2 + 1, therefore if we make a variable as `candidate` and keep on increasing the count if we meet that candidate agian and decreasing the count if we meet any other element. Whenever the count becomes 0, we reinitialise the `candidate` with current number and reinitialise the `count` with 1 again.
```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        candidate = nums[0]
        cnt = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if num == candidate:
                cnt += 1
            elif cnt == 0:
                candidate = num
                cnt = 1
            else:
                cnt -= 1
        return candidate
```
