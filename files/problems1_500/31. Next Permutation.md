# Problem
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

- For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

- For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
- Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
- While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

Example 2
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]
```
# Answer
```python
class Solution:
    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # 找到左右的一个「较小值」和右边的一个「较大值」，然后把它们交换
        # 交换结束后，将原来较小值位置右边所有的数按照升序重新排列
        i = len(nums) - 2
        while i >= 0 and nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            i -= 1

        if i > 0: 
            j = len(nums) - 1
            while j >= 0 and nums[i] >= nums[j]:
                j -= 1
            # 交换较大值和较小值
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
        
        l, r = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            nums[l], nums[r] = nums[r], nums[l]
            l += 1
            r -= 1
        return nums
