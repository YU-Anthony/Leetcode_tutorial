## Node Indegree
> 参考答案：https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/solution/

We first construct the graph and the in-degree of all courses. Then process all courses with 0 in-degree implying no prerequisites courses required. If we remove all the courses from graph, along with their outgoing edges, we can find out the courses that should be processed next. These would again be the nodes with 0-indegree. We can continuously do this until all the courses have been accounted for.
```python
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        indegrees = defaultdict(int)
        
        for u, v in prerequisites:
            graph[v].append(u)
            indegrees[u] += 1
        
        path = []
        queue = deque([k for k in range(numCourses) if indegrees[k] == 0])
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            path.append(node)
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                indegrees[neighbor] -= 1
                if indegrees[neighbor] == 0:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        return path if len(path) == numCourses else []

        preMap = defaultdict(list)
        # preMap = {i : [] for i in range(numCourses)}
        for crs, pre in prerequisites:
            preMap[crs].append(pre)
        # 0 = Unknown, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited
        visited = [0] * numCourses
        ans = []
        
        def dfs(i):
            if visited[i] == 1: # find a cycle
                return False
            if visited[i] == 2:
                return True
            visited[i] = 1

                if not dfs(pre):
                    return False
            visited[i] = 2
            ans.append(i)
            return True
