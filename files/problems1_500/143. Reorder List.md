# Problem
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
```
L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
```
Reorder the list to be on the following form:
```
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
```
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```

Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 1000

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        # find middle
        slow = fast = head
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        mid = slow
        
        # reverse second half
        r_head = mid.next
        mid.next = None # 断开左右两部分连接
        prev = None
        while r_head:
            tmp = r_head.next
            r_head.next = prev
            prev = r_head
            r_head = tmp
        
        # merge two halfs
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1
            first, second = tmp1, tmp2
