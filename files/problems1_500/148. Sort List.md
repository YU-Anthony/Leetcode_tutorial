# Problem
Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in *ascending order*.

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/sort_list_1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/sort_list_2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
```

Example 3
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
- -105 <= Node.val <= 105

**Follow up**: Can you sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1) memory (i.e. constant space)?

# Answer
因为前面刚写了 `insertion sort`于是想当然的用了插排的方法，结果发现超时了，再看了下题目原来要求我们时间复杂度为`O(nlogn)`,要达到`O(nlogn)`当然得用`merge sort`了。

So all we need to do is to split our list into two parts, sort the first half, then sort the second half and finally merge this two parts.

- getMid(head), which will find the middle of list with given head and cut it into two smaller lists. We use the idea of slow and fast pointers here to find middle efficiently.
- merge(head1, head2) will merge two lists with given heads. To make it more readible and to avoid corner cases, it is good idea to use dummy sentinel node in the beginning of list. We iterate over two lists, using two pointers and add them one by one. When we out of nodes, we attach the rest of on of the lists to the end, we return the start of our new list.
- sortList(head): it is our original function: if list has length 0 or 1, we do not do anything, it is corner case of our recursion. If it is not the case, we find mid = self.getMid(head), which will cut our list into two smaller lists and return the start of the second list. Finally, we apply sortList() to head and to mid and merge two parts.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        mid = self.findMid(head)
        left = self.sortList(head)
        right = self.sortList(mid)
        return self.merge(left, right)
    
    def findMid(self, head):
        slow = fast = head
        
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        mid = slow.next
        slow.next = None
        return mid
    
    def merge(self, l1, l2):
        curr = dummy = ListNode()

        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                curr.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                curr.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            curr = curr.next
        curr.next = l1 if l1 is not None else l2
        return dummy.next
```
- TC: O(nlogn)
- SC: O(logn)
Actually, the Space Cost for this recursion version of `merge sort` is `O(logn)`, and for the `O(1)` one, we need to change the above solution to `Bottom-to-up` version.

We will handle it later.
