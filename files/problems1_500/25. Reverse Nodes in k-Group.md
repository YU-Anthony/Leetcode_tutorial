# Problem
Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is n.
- 1 <= k <= n <= 5000
- 0 <= Node.val <= 1000

# Answer
### Iteration
我们需要四个指针
- dummy：point to the head of original linked list
- cur: used to iterate each node
- prev: The previous node of first node in each group
- groupHead: The first node of each group
The basic idea is to use `prev` pointer to connect each reversed group. Then update `prev` with the origin `groupHead` as `groupHead` become the last node in the reversed group. For those group whose value less than `k`, we just need to connect it with `groupHead`

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        curr = head

        count = 0
        while curr:
            groupHead = curr
            for _ in range(k):
                if not curr:
                    break
                count += 1
                curr = curr.next
            if count % k != 0: # reverse the k nodes
                prev.next = groupHead
            else:
                prev.next = self.reverse(groupHead, k)
                prev = groupHead
        return dummy.next
    
    def reverse(self, head, k):
        prev = None
        curr = head
        
        while curr and k > 0:
            tmp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = tmp
            k -= 1
        return prev

```

### Recursion
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head:
            return None
        prev = curr = head
        for _ in range(k):
            if not curr:
                return head
            curr = curr.next
        
        newHead = self.reverse(prev, k)
        prev.next = self.reverseKGroup(curr, k)
        return newHead
        
    def reverse(self, head, k):
        prev = None
        curr = head
        
        while curr and k > 0:
            tmp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = tmp
            k -= 1
        return prev
```
