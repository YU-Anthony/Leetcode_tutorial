# Problem
Given a list of unique words, return all the pairs of the distinct indices (i, j) in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.

Example 1
```
Input: words = ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["dcbaabcd","abcddcba","slls","llssssll"]
```

Example 2
```
Input: words = ["bat","tab","cat"]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The palindromes are ["battab","tabbat"]
```

Example 3
```
Input: words = ["a",""]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0]]
```

There are three ways that w1 + w2 would be palindrome
- len(w1) == len(w2) and the reversed w1 equals to w2
- len(w1) > len(w2), w1 starts with reversed w2 and the remaining part of w1 would be palindrome itself
- len(w1) < len(w2), w2 starts with reversed w1 and the remaining part of w2 would be palindrome itself

```python
class Solution:
    def palindromePairs(self, words: List[str]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = {w: i for i, w in enumerate(words)}
        ans = []

        for i, s in enumerate(words):
            word = s[::-1]
            if word in res and res[word] != i:
                ans.append([i, res[word]])
            for j in range(1, len(s) + 1):
                if word[j:] in res and word[:j] == s[-j:]:
                    ans.append([i, res[word[j:]]])
                if word[:-j] in res and word[-j:] == s[:j]:
                    ans.append([res[word[:-j]], i])
        return ans
```
