# Problem
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of four, if there exists an integer x such that n == 4^x.

Example 1
```
Input: n = 16
Output: true
```

Example 2
```
Input: n = 5
Output: false
```

Example 3
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
```
# Answer
The most direct solution for this problem is to use loop/recursion. We keep dividing a number by 4 until we cannot divid it. If the result equals to 1, this number must be the power of 4. Otherwise, it is not.

But this problem ask us not to use the loop. So we should use bit manipulation method. But, there are several points we should pay attention to.
1. If a number is the power of 4, it cannot be a negative one.
2. If a number is the power of 4, it must also be a power of 2. So, for any number who is the power of 2, it should follow this rule -> n & (n - 1) == 0
3. We see there is rule of the numbers who are the power of 2. There is also a rule for the numbers who are the power of 4.
Suppose n is the power of 4. There is an unique number `1010101010101010101010101010101` that satisifies n & `1010101010101010101010101010101` == n

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfFour(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        if n & (n - 1) != 0:
            return False
        if n & 0x55555555 == n:
            return True
        return False
```
