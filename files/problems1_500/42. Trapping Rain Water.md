# Problem

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

Constraints:
- n == height.length
- 1 <= n <= 2 * 104
- 0 <= height[i] <= 105

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        
        if not height: return 0
        
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        leftMax = height[l]
        rightMax = height[r]
        res = 0
        
        while l < r:
            if leftMax < rightMax:
                l += 1
                leftMax = max(leftMax, height[l])
                res += leftMax - height[l]
            else:
                r -= 1
                rightMax = max(rightMax, height[r])
                res += rightMax - height[r]
        return res
