# Problem
There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

Example 1

```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

Example 2
```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```
# Answer
### Solution: Math
Combination formula
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Total permutations = (m -1 + n + 1)! / ((m - 1)! * (n - 1)!)
        """
        return int(math.factorial(m + n - 2) / math.factorial(m - 1) / math.factorial(n - 1))
```
### Solution: DP
`dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]`
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        """
        (m - 1)C(m + n - 2)
        """
        dp = [[1] * n] + [[1] + [0]*(n - 1) for _ in range(m - 1)]
        
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1]
        return dp[-1][-1]
```
