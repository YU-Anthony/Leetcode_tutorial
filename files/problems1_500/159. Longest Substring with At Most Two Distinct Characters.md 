# Question
Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring that contains at most two distinct characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "eceba"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring is "aabbb" which its length is 5.
```

# Answer
We could use the template of Sliding window.
```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:
        l=ret=0
        res=defaultdict(int)
        cnt=0
        for r, val in enumerate(s):
            res[val]+=1
            if len(res)<=2:
                ret=max(ret,r-l+1)
            while len(res)>2:
                res[s[l]]-=1
                if res[s[l]]==0:
                    del res[s[l]]
                l+=1
        return ret
```
