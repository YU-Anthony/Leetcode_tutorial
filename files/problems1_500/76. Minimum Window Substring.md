# Probelm
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Example 1
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

Example 2
```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

Example 3
```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

Constraints
- m == s.length
- n == t.length
- 1 <= m, n <= 105
- s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
# Answer
- We start by fixing the left pointer and move the right pointer to the right. 

- The way we determine the current window is a valid one is by checking all the target letters are found in the window. 
    - If we are in a valid sliding window, we first update the **minimum window length**
    - Next we try to contact the sliding window by moving the left pointer.
        - If the sliding window continues to be valid, we keep updating the **minimum window length**
        - If it becomes invalid, we break out the inner loop and go back to move the right pointer to the right.

            if c in freq and window[c] == freq[c]:
                matched += 1
            # 这个条件是控制窗口左移的关键
            while matched == len(freq):
                # 找到窗口后更新最小窗口大小和窗口开始位置
                if r - l + 1 < min_length:
                    min_length = r - l + 1
                    start = l
                # 为了优化窗口大小，我们将窗口左端向右移
                window[s[l]] -= 1
                if s[l] in freq and window[s[l]] < freq[s[l]]:
                    # 我们向右移动窗口左端的时候有可能去掉的是 redundant matching characters
                    matched -= 1

- TC: O(n)
- SC: O(C), 这里用了两张哈希表作为辅助空间，每张哈希表最多不会存放超过字符集大小的键值对，我们设字符集大小为 C ，则渐进空间复杂度为 O(C)。
