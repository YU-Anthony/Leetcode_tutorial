# Question
You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

Example 1
```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

Example 2
```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```

# Answer
We can use the template of `Sliding Window` to solve this problem. The key point here is `(r -l + 1 - max(res.values()) > k` which means that if the characters that allowed to be changed larger than k, we need to increase the left bound to narrow the `characters that allowed to be changed` within the arrange gived to us(which is k).

The problems says that we can make at most `k` changes to the string. The answer to this is
```
(length of substring - number of times of the maximum occuring character in the substring) <= k
```

Every time we explore a new character by expand the `right` boundary. At the same time, we check whether the length of substring is greater of equal to the number of times of maximum occuring character in the substring. If it is, we keep exploring new character, otherwise we have to update the `left` boundary cause we have run out of `k` budget.
```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        l = ret = 0
        res = defaultdict(int)
        for r, val in enumerate(s):
            res[val] += 1
            while (r - l + 1) - max(res.values()) > k:
                res[s[l]] -= 1
                if res[s[l]] == 0:
                    del res[s[l]]
                l+=1
            ret = max(ret, r - l + 1)
        return ret
```
