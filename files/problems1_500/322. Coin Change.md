# Problem
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

Example 1
```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

Example 2
```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

Constraints
- 1 <= coins.length <= 12
- 1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1
- 0 <= amount <= 104
# Answer
## Dynamic Programming
dp[0] means if we want to computer amount 0 that it only takes 0 coins. Then, we start compute every value in dp, for every value in dp, we go through coin. If a - c is non negative, that means we can continue searching, also means we possibily find a solution for our dp. Specificly, for this amount a we gonna set it to the minimum of itself and 1 + dp[a - c].

In the end, we return what we are looking for, just return dp[amount] if dp[amount] has a minimum value, otherwise return -1.
```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] + [float("inf")] * (amount)
        
        for a in range(1, amount + 1):
            for c in coins:
                if a - c >= 0:
                    dp[a] = min(dp[a], dp[a - c] + 1)
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float("inf") else -1
```
- TC: O(amount * len(coins))
- SC: O(amount)
