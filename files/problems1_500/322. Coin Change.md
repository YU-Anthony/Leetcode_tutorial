# Problem
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

Example 1
```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

Example 2
```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

Constraints
- 1 <= coins.length <= 12
- 1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1
- 0 <= amount <= 104
# Answer
## Dynamic Programming
We could use dynamic programming method and create `dp[i]`, for each index i means the minimum number of coins needed to make change of amount i using coins [c0, c1, ..., cn-1]

dp[0] means if we want to compute amount 0 that it only takes 0 coins. Then, we start compute every value in dp, for every value in dp, we go through coin. If a - c is non negative, that means we can continue searching, also means we possibily find a solution for our dp. Specificly, for this amount a we gonna set it to the minimum of itself and 1 + dp[a - c].

In the end, we return what we are looking for, just return dp[amount] if dp[amount] has a minimum value, otherwise return -1.

    这道题不能使用贪心思想的原因：
    假设有三种硬币，面额分别为 1、5、11，需要凑成金额 15。使用贪心算法，我们优先选取面额为 11 的硬币，因为它是面额最大的硬币。但是这样会得到一个错误的结果，因为最优解是选取一个面额为 5 的硬币和一个面额为 10 的硬币，共计两枚硬币，而贪心算法得到的是面额为 11 的硬币和面额为 4 的硬币，共计两枚硬币，这并不是最优解。
    """
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] + [float("inf")] * (amount)
        
        for a in range(1, amount + 1):
            for c in coins:
                if a - c >= 0:
                    dp[a] = min(dp[a], dp[a - c] + 1)
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float("inf") else -1
