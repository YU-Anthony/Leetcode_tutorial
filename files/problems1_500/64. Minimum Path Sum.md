# Problem
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/minpath.jpg)
```
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
```

Example 2
```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
```
# Answer
### Dynamic Programming
```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        dp = [[0] * COLS for _ in range(ROWS)]
        for i in range(ROWS):
            for j in range(COLS):
                if i == j == 0: 
                    dp[i][j] = grid[i][j]
                elif i == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + grid[i][j]
                elif j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + grid[i][j]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j]) + grid[i][j]
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

### DP + Space Optimization
```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for i in range(ROWS):
            for j in range(COLS):
                if i == j == 0: continue
                elif i == 0:
                    grid[i][j] = grid[i][j - 1] + grid[i][j]
                elif j == 0:
                    grid[i][j] = grid[i - 1][j] + grid[i][j]
                else:
                    grid[i][j] = min(grid[i][j - 1], grid[i - 1][j]) + grid[i][j]
        return grid[-1][-1]
```
