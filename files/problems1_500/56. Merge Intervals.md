# Problem
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

Example 1
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
```

Example 2
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

Constraints
- 1 <= intervals.length <= 104
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 0 <= starti <= endi <= 104
# Answer
Let us sort these intervals by their `starti` firstly. Then iterate them one by one.
During each iteration, we have two choices:
- If `endi` of `curr` interval >= `starti` of next interval,it means these two intervals are overlapping, we need to update the `curr` interval by merging them together.
- In the opposite, there is a `gap` between these two intervals, we need to add the `curr` interval to the final answer, and compare `next` interval with `next's next` interval. 
```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        intervals = sorted(intervals)
        
        ans = []
        curr = intervals[0]
        
        for interval in intervals[1: ]:
            if curr[1] >= interval[0]:
                curr = [curr[0], max(interval[1], curr[1])]
            else:
                ans.append(curr)
                curr = interval
        ans.append(curr)
        return ans
```
- TC: O(nlogn) to sort intervals
- SC: O(n) to keep sorted intervals and ans
