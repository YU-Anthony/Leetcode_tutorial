# Question

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```bash
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

Example 2:
```bash
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

# Answer
打家劫舍这道题是动态规划问题中比较经典的一道题。
动态规划可以分四个步骤：
1. 定义子问题
2. 写出子问题的递推公式
3. 确定 DP 数组计算顺序
4. 空间优化

两种情况选择金额较大的那一种，所以
f(k) = max(f(k-1),f(k-2)+H_(k-1))

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        m1,m2=0,0
        for i in nums:
            m1,m2 = m2,max(m2,m1+i)
        return m2
```
