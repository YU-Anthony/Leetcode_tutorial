# Problem
There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).

Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

Example 1
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

Example 2
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```
# Answer
This problem is slightly different with `leetcode 33`. We cannot directly use the solution of `lc 33`. This is becuase we cannot make sure which half the `mid` pointe belong to. For example, for array `[2, 2, 2, 1, 2]` and `[2, 1, 2, 2, 2]`, `nums[l] == nums[mid] == nums[r]` and we want to find target `1`, 1 could either belong to the left half or right half. In this situation, we just need to remove the duplicate elements. To remove duplicate elements:
- shift `l` pointer to right while `nums[l] == nums[l + 1]`
- shift `r` pointer to left while `nums[r] == nums[r - 1]`

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        while l <= r:
            while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l + 1]:
                l += 1
            while l < r and nums[r] == nums[r - 1]:
                r -= 1
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if target == nums[mid]:
                return True
            # left sorted part
            if nums[mid] >= nums[l]:
                if nums[l] <= target < nums[mid]:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            else:
                if nums[mid] < target <= nums[r]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
        return False
```
