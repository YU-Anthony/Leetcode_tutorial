# Problem
Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

Example 1:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation:
2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
These are the only two combinations.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8
Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: candidates = [2], target = 1
Output: []
```

# Answer
This ia a classical `backtracking` problem, we need to use the `backtracking` function.
For this function, we need three input variable
- `remain`, if we get some number, we substract it from remain
- `curr_sol`, is current solution built so far
- `k`, is the start index of the candidates. Why we need `k`. The is to avoid the duplication of answers, so that we don't need to iterate all numbers in the candidates each time.

In the function, we do
- If `remain == 0`, we append the `curr_sol` to the final answer
- If `remain < 0`, we need to go back
- If `remain > 0`, we iterate the candidates start with index `k` and update the parameters.
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = []

        def backtrack(remain, cur_sol, k):
            if remain == 0:
                ans.append(cur_sol)
                return
            if remain < 0:
                return
            for i in range(k, len(candidates)):
                backtrack(remain - candidates[i], cur_sol + [candidates[i]], i)
        backtrack(target, [], 0)
        return ans
```

另一种方法：
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        
        def backtrack(i, cur, total):
            if total == target:
                res.append(cur.copy())
                return
            if total > target or i >= len(candidates):
                return
            
            cur.append(candidates[i])
            backtrack(i, cur, total + candidates[i])
            cur.pop()
            backtrack(i + 1, cur, total)
        backtrack(0, [], 0)
        return res
```

## Backtrakcing, 按照代码随想录的模版写的
```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        path = []
        
        def backtracking(startIndex, total):
            if total == target:
                res.append(path[:])
                return
            if total > target:
                return
            
            for i in range(startIndex, len(candidates)):
                if total + candidates[i] > target:
                    return
                total += candidates[i]
                path.append(candidates[i])
                backtracking(i, total)
                total -= candidates[i]
                path.pop()
        candidates.sort() # 注意这里要先 sort
        backtracking(0, 0)
        
        return res
```
