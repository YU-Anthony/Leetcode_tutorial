# Problem
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsumii1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]
Explanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22
```

Example 2
```
Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: []
```
# Answer
## DFS
```python
class TreeNode:
  def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
    self.val = val
    self.left = left
    self.right = right


def find_paths(root, sum):
  allPaths = []
  # TODO: Write your code here
  def helper(node, currentPath, allPaths, target):
    if not node:
      return 
    currentPath.append(node.val)
    if not node.left and not node.right and node.val == target:
      allPaths.append(currentPath[:])
    else:
      helper(node.left, currentPath, allPaths, target - node.val)
      helper(node.right, currentPath, allPaths, target - node.val)
    currentPath.pop()

  helper(root, [], allPaths, sum)
  return allPaths
```
