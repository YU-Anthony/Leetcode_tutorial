# Problem
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev2ex2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

Example 2
```
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
```

Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is n.
- 1 <= n <= 500
- -500 <= Node.val <= 500
- 1 <= left <= right <= n
# Answer

For this problem, we need four pointers:
- dummy: be used to connect the head of linked list
- pre: the previous node of left. Actually, the area between first node and `pre` node(include) are stable.
- cur: the current node need to be reversed
- tmp: cur.next
The basic idea is to inset the next node of `cur` after `pre` node (right - left times).
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or left == right:
            return head
        
        pre = dummy = ListNode()
        dummy.next = head
        
        for i in range(left - 1):
            pre = pre.next
            
        cur = pre.next
        for j in range(right - left):
            tmp = cur.next
            cur.next = tmp.next
            tmp.next = pre.next
            pre.next = tmp
        return dummy.next
```
