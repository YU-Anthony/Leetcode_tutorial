# Question
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1:

```bash
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 2:

```bash
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

# Answer
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        # 方法一：遍历
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        temp = head
        while head and head.next:
            if head.val == head.next.val:
                head.next = head.next.next
            else:
                head = head.next
        return temp
        
        # 方法二：递归
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        head.next = self.deleteDuplicates(head.next)
        if head.val == head.next.val:
            head.next = head.next.next
        return head
```
