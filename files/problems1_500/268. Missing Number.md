# Problem
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

Constraints:
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 104
- 0 <= nums[i] <= n
- All the numbers of nums are unique.

# Answer
多种方法求解

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
#         # 排序做比较
#         # TC: O(nlogn), SC: O(n)
#         nums = sorted(nums)
#         for idx, val in enumerate(nums):
#             if idx != val:
#                 return idx
#         return len(nums)
        
#         # 作差法：
#         # TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
#         n = len(nums)
#         ans = n * (n + 1) // 2
        
#         return ans - sum(nums)
        

        # 异或法
        # TC: O(n), SC: O(1)
        ans = 0
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n + 1):
            ans ^= i
        for num in nums:
            ans ^= num
        return ans
