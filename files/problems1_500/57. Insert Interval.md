# Problem
You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return intervals after the insertion.

Example 1
```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

Example 2
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
```
# Answer
```python
class Solution:
    def insert(self, intervals: List[List[int]], newInterval: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Keep track of final list
        final = []
        
        # Iterate through all intervals
        for inter in intervals:
            # If new interval is under the range of current interval, append it to final
            if newInterval[1] < inter[0]:
                final.append(newInterval)
                newInterval = inter  # Set new interval to current interval
            
            # If new interval is over the range of current interval, append current interval to final
            elif newInterval[0] > inter[1]:
                final.append(inter)
            
            # Otherwise, keep the min of first index & max of second index
            else:
                newInterval = [min(newInterval[0], inter[0]), max(newInterval[1], inter[1])]
        
        # Append newInterval if it exists by the end of the loop
        return final + [newInterval]
