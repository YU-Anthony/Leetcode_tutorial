When we see `level`, we should consider `BFS`. Its logic here is it first traverse all neighbors befor going deeper. Here we also need to change the direction of each level as well. So the algorithm is:
- We create queue, where we first store root here.
- `ans` is to keep final result, and `direction` equals to `1` or `-1` is the direction of each level.
- Then we start to travere level by level: if we have `k` elements in queue currently, we remove them all and put their children instead until the queue is empty. Meanwhile, we form `level` list and then add it to `ans` by using the correct direction and change the direction after.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def zigzagLevelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root:
            return []
        queue = deque([root])
        direction = 1
        ans = []

        while queue:
            level = []
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                level.append(node.val)
                if node.left: queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right: queue.append(node.right)
            ans.append(level[::direction])
            direction *= -1
        return ans
```
