# Problem
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x.

Example 1
```
Input: n = 27
Output: true
```
# Answer
If an integer is the power of three, it must can divides 3^19. Since 3^19 is the largest power of 3 (signed 32-bit integer)
```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n > 0 and 3**19 % n == 0
```
