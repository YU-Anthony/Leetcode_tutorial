# Problem
You are given an m x n grid rooms initialized with these three possible values.

- -1 A wall or an obstacle.
- 0 A gate.
- INF Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/03/grid.jpg)
```
Input: rooms = [[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]]
Output: [[3,-1,0,1],[2,2,1,-1],[1,-1,2,-1],[0,-1,3,4]]
```

Example 2
```
Input: rooms = [[-1]]
Output: [[-1]]
```

```python
class Solution:
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify rooms in-place instead.
        """

        m, n = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
        # 先把有门的地方都放进来，定义有门的地方path距离是0

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if rooms[i][j] == 0:

        while q:

            for choice in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                nr,nc = r+choice[0],c+choice[1]
                if 0<=nr<m and 0<=nc<n and 2147483647 == rooms[nr][nc]:
                    rooms[nr][nc] = path+1
                    q.append((nr,nc,path+1))
