# Problem

### Solution 1: BFS
To solve this problem, we need three things.
- BFS to traverse the graph
- A `hashmap` to keep track of already visited and cloned nodes
- A `queue` to keep track of nodes than we can visit in the next tick

So, every time we push a node from `queue` and we need to make sure the node is already cloned.
    - If the neighbor of the node is not cloned and visited, we cloned it first and apppend it to the queue for visit later. We also need to append it to the current clone list
    - If the neighbor of the node is visited, we just need to append it to the current clone list.

### Solution 2: DFS
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val = 0, neighbors = None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []
"""

class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        clones = {}
        
        def dfs(node):
            if node in clones:
                return clones[node]
            
            copy = Node(node.val)
            clones[node] = copy
            for ngb in node.neighbors:
                copy.neighbors.append(dfs(ngb))
            return copy
        
        return dfs(node) if node else None
```
