# Problem
# Answer
1. We keep track of the current path in a list which wil be passed to every recrusive call
2. Whenever we traverse a node we will do two things
    - Add the current node to the current path.
    - FInd the sums of all sub-paths ending at the current node. If the sum of any sub-path is equal to 'S', we increment our path count
3. Traverse all paths
4. Remove the current node from the current path before returing from the function. This is needed to Backtrack while we are going up the recrusive call stack to process other paths.
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> int:
        
        def helper(node, target, currPath):
            if not node:
                return 0
            currPath.append(node.val)
            pathCount, currSum = 0, 0
            # find the sum of all sub-paths in the current path list
            for i in range(len(currPath) - 1, - 1, -1):
                currSum += currPath[i]
                # if the sum of any sub-path is equal to targetSum, 
                if currSum == target:
                    pathCount += 1
            pathCount += helper(node.left, target, currPath)
            pathCount += helper(node.right, target, currPath)
            # we need to remove the current node while we are going up the recrusive call stack
            currPath.pop()
            
            return pathCount
        
        return helper(root, targetSum, [])
