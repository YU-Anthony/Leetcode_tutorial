# Problems
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example 1
```bash
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

Example 2
```bash
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

Example 2
```bash
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

Constraints
- `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

# Answer
`动态规划`
Step 1：定义状态
定义`dp[i][j]`表示到下标为`i`这一天，持股状态为`j`时，我们的收益。
```
dp[i][0] 表示第i天结束后手里没有股票的最大收益
dp[i][1] 表示第i天结束后手里有股票的最大收益
```
Step 2: 思考状态转移方程
```
dp[i][0]
第i天没有持有股票，有可能是第`i-1`天手里就没有股票；或者`i-1`天手里有股票，我们在第`i`天卖掉了这支股票。
dp[i][1]
第i天持有股票，有可能是第`i-1`天手里就有股票；或者`i-1`天手里没有股票，我们在第`i`天买入了一支股票。
```
因此
dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i])
dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0] - prices[i])
```
```
Step 3: 确定初始值
```
dp[0][0] = 0
dp[0][1] = -prices[i] # (相当于最开始没钱的时候借钱去买股票)
```
Step 4: 确定输出值

当全部交易结束后，持有股票的收益一定低于没有持有股票的收益，因此我们只需要输出 `dp[n-1][0]`

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
        n = len(prices)
        dp = [[0, 0] for _ in range(n)]
        dp[0][0] = 0
        dp[0][1] = -prices[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i])
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][0] - prices[i])
        
        return dp[n-1][0]
```
