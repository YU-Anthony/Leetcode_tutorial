# Problem
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Example 1
```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

Example 2
```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
```

Example 3
```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
```
# Answer
### Solution: Dynamic Programming
dp[i] is `True` if there is a word in `wordDict` that ends at `ith` index of `s`. **`AND`** is also `True` at `dp[i - len(word)]`
```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        dp = [False]*(n + 1)
        dp[0] = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                if dp[i] and s[i : j] in wordDict:
                    dp[j] = True
        return dp[-1]
```
