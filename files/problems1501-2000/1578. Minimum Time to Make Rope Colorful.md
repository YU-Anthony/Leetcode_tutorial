# Problem
# Answer
For each move, we always record the largest time in current group and add other smaller time in the same group to `totalTime`. To be more specifically, when we meet a time `t[i]` that belongs to the current group, we compare it with `currMaxTime`, add the smaller one to `totalTime` and leave the larger one as `currMaxTime`.
```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, colors: str, neededTime: List[int]) -> int:
        total = 0
        cur_max_time = 0
        for i in range(len(colors)):
            if i > 0 and colors[i] != colors[i - 1]:
                cur_max_time = 0
                
            total += min(cur_max_time, neededTime[i])
            cur_max_time = max(cur_max_time, neededTime[i])
        return total
```
