# Problem
You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and some ladders.

You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders.

While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),

- If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do not need a ladder or bricks.
- If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/27/q4.gif)
```bash
Input: heights = [4,2,7,6,9,14,12], bricks = 5, ladders = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Starting at building 0, you can follow these steps:
- Go to building 1 without using ladders nor bricks since 4 >= 2.
- Go to building 2 using 5 bricks. You must use either bricks or ladders because 2 < 7.
- Go to building 3 without using ladders nor bricks since 7 >= 6.
- Go to building 4 using your only ladder. You must use either bricks or ladders because 6 < 9.
It is impossible to go beyond building 4 because you do not have any more bricks or ladders.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: heights = [4,12,2,7,3,18,20,3,19], bricks = 10, ladders = 2
Output: 7
```

Example 3:
```
Input: heights = [14,3,19,3], bricks = 17, ladders = 0
Output: 3
```

Constraints
- 1 <= heights.length <= 105
- 1 <= heights[i] <= 106
- 0 <= bricks <= 109
- 0 <= ladders <= heights.length

# Answer
找到题其实蛮有特色的，首先我们要明确
1. 下楼不花费工具，上楼才花费工具
2. 梯子相当于无限使用砖块
那梯子肯定是最珍贵的，我们只有对爬行过程中，上楼高度最高的那几次使用梯子才物超所值。所以一个简单的思路就是，统计所有爬楼的过程，对爬楼高度最高的几次使用梯子，剩下的使用砖块，这个可以有`priority queue ` 来实现
```python
class Solution:
    def furthestBuilding(self, heights: List[int], bricks: int, ladders: int) -> int:
        n = len(heights)
        queue = list()
        sumq = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(heights)):
            diff = heights[i] - heights[i - 1]
            if diff > 0:
                heapq.heappush(queue, diff)
                if len(queue) > ladders:
                    sumq += heapq.heappop(queue)
                if sumq > bricks:
                    return i - 1
        return n - 1
```
- TC: O(nlogl), l 为梯子的数量，优先队列里最多 l 个元素，单次操作是 logl, 外部循环遍历 n 次
- OC: O(l), l 为梯子的数量
