这道题没啥意思，不需要额外花心思
```python
class SeatManager:

    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.heap = list(range(1, n + 1))

    def reserve(self) -> int:
        return heapq.heappop(self.heap)

    def unreserve(self, seatNumber: int) -> None:
        heapq.heappush(self.heap, seatNumber)
        


# Your SeatManager object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = SeatManager(n)
# param_1 = obj.reserve()
# obj.unreserve(seatNumber)
```
