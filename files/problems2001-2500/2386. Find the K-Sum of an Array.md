# Problem
You are given an integer array nums and a positive integer k. You can choose any subsequence of the array and sum all of its elements together.

We define the K-Sum of the array as the kth largest subsequence sum that can be obtained (not necessarily distinct).

Return the K-Sum of the array.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Note that the empty subsequence is considered to have a sum of 0.

Example 1
```
Input: nums = [2,4,-2], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: All the possible subsequence sums that we can obtain are the following sorted in decreasing order:
- 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, -2.
The 5-Sum of the array is 2.
```

Example 2
```
Input: nums = [1,-2,3,4,-10,12], k = 16
Output: 10
Explanation: The 16-Sum of the array is 10.

```

这道题有几个思想：
1.  largest subsequence sum must be the sum of all positive numbers
2. 因为数组中有正数有负数，剔除一个正数那就直接减了，剔除一个负数相当于加它本身，因此我们干脆直接将所有数转变为它的绝对值，然后在后续讨论 subsequence sum 的时候直接减去这个数
3. x + vals[i] means we are subtracting (or taking this) for the paths that was constructed previously. x-vals[i-1]+vals[i] means we are taking this alone and not the values from previous paths.
```python
class Solution:
    def kSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        m = sum(x for x in nums if x > 0)
        pq = [(-m , 0)]
        vals = sorted(abs(x) for x in nums)
        
        for _ in range(k):
            x, i = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if i < len(nums):
                heapq.heappush(pq, (x + vals[i], i + 1))
                if i: heapq.heappush(pq, (x - vals[i - 1] + vals[i], i + 1))
        return -x
