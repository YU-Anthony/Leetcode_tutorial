# Problem
An integer array original is transformed into a doubled array changed by appending twice the value of every element in original, and then randomly shuffling the resulting array.

Given an array changed, return original if changed is a doubled array. If changed is not a doubled array, return an empty array. The elements in original may be returned in any order.

Example 1
```
Input: changed = [1,3,4,2,6,8]
Output: [1,3,4]
Explanation: One possible original array could be [1,3,4]:
- Twice the value of 1 is 1 * 2 = 2.
- Twice the value of 3 is 3 * 2 = 6.
- Twice the value of 4 is 4 * 2 = 8.
Other original arrays could be [4,3,1] or [3,1,4].
```

Example 2
```
Input: changed = [6,3,0,1]
Output: []
Explanation: changed is not a doubled array.
```

Constraints
- 1 <= changed.length <= 105
- 0 <= changed[i] <= 105
# Answer
这道题其实就是遍历sort后的数组，对于当前数如果能找到它的2倍数，就把当前数和它的二倍数同时`➖1`，否则就无法凑齐一对 pair 然后就说明这个数组不符合要求。
```python
class Solution:
    def findOriginalArray(self, changed: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        if len(changed) % 2 != 0:
            return []
        res, ans = Counter(changed), []
        for num in sorted(changed, key=lambda x:abs(x)):
            if not res[num]:
                continue
            if not res[2 * num]:
                return []
            ans += [num]
            res[num] -= 1
            res[2 * num] -= 1
            
        return ans
```
