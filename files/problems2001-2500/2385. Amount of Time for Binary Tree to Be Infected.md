`graph`, `binary tree`
# Problem
You are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and an integer start. At minute 0, an infection starts from the node with value start.

Each minute, a node becomes infected if:

- The node is currently uninfected.
- The node is adjacent to an infected node.
Return the number of minutes needed for the entire tree to be infected.

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/25/image-20220625231744-1.png)
```
Input: root = [1,5,3,null,4,10,6,9,2], start = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The following nodes are infected during:
- Minute 0: Node 3
- Minute 1: Nodes 1, 10 and 6
- Minute 2: Node 5
- Minute 3: Node 4
- Minute 4: Nodes 9 and 2
It takes 4 minutes for the whole tree to be infected so we return 4.
```

Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/06/25/image-20220625231812-2.png)
```
Input: root = [1], start = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: At minute 0, the only node in the tree is infected so we return 0.

# Answer
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def amountOfTime(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], start: int) -> int:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        stack = [(root, None)]
        
        while stack:
            n, p = stack.pop()
            if p:
                graph[n.val].append(p.val)
                graph[p.val].append(n.val)
            if n.left: stack.append((n.left, n))
            if n.right: stack.append((n.right, n))
        
        ans = -1
        seen = {start}
        queue = deque([start])
        
        while queue:
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                u = queue.popleft()
                for v in graph[u]:
                    if v not in seen:
                        seen.add(v)
                        queue.append(v)
            ans += 1
        return ans
```
