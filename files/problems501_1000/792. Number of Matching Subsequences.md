# Problem
Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of s.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

Example 1
```
Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".
```

Example 2
```
Input: s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
Output: 2
```

Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
- 1 <= words.length <= 5000
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 50
- s and words[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.

### Solution 1: 暴力破解
```python
class Solution:
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        res = []
        for word in words:
            if self.findWord(s, word):
                ans += 1
                res.append(word)
        return ans
    
    def findWord(self, s, word):
        start = 0
        for c in word:
            found = False
            for i in range(start, len(s)):
                if c == s[i]:
                    start = i + 1
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found: return False
        return True
```

### Solution 2: Binary Search
```python
class Solution:
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, s, words):
        def isSubseq(word):
            curr = 0
            for c in word:
                ind = bisect_left(places[c], curr)
                # print(c, curr, ind)
                if ind >= len(places[c]):
                    return False
                curr = places[c][ind] + 1
            
            return True
        
        places = defaultdict(list)
        for i, symbol in enumerate(s):
            places[symbol].append(i)
        
        return sum(isSubseq(word) for word in words)
