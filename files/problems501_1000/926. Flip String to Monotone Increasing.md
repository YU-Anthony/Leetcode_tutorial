The idea is to discard all initial 0s, and then determine which requires fewer flips: changing the remaining string to all `0` or change it to all `1`.
```python
class Solution:
    def minFlipsMonoIncr(self, s: str) -> int:
        ans, ones = 0, 0

        for num in s:
            if num == '1':
                ones += 1
            elif ones:
                ones -= 1
                ans += 1
        return ans
```
