# Problem

## BFS
```python
class Solution:
    def possibleBipartition(self, n: int, dislikes: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        def bfs(source):
            q = collections.deque([source])
            color[source] = 0 # Start with marking source as 'RED'
            while q:
                node = q.popleft()
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    # If there is a conflict, return false.
                    if color[neighbor] == color[node]: return False
                    if color[neighbor] == -1:
                        color[neighbor] = 1 - color[node]
                        q.append(neighbor)
            
            return True
        
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in dislikes:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        
        color = [-1] * (n + 1) # -1 stands for not colored, 0 stands for red and 1 stands for blue.
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if color[i] == -1:
                # For each pending component, run BFS.
                if not bfs(i):
                    # Return false, if there is conflict in the component.
                    return False
        
        return True
```
Let E be the size of dislikes and N be the number of people.

- Time complexity: O(N+E)

Each node is only queued once, which takes O(1) time for each node. We also iterate over the edges of every node once (since we only visit each node once, we won't iterate over a node's edges multiple times), which adds O(E) time.
We also need O(E) to initialize the adjacency list and O(N) to initialize the color array.

- Space complexity: O(N+E)

In the worst case, the queue can grow to a size linear with N.
We also require O(E) and O(N)) space for the adjacency list and the color array respectively.
