# Problem
There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces (represented as 0) and walls (represented as 1). The ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.

Given the m x n maze, the ball's start position and the destination, where start = [startrow, startcol] and destination = [destinationrow, destinationcol], return the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. If the ball cannot stop at destination, return -1.

The distance is the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included).

You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls (see examples).

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/31/maze1-1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: maze = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[1,1,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0]], start = [0,4], destination = [4,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: One possible way is : left -> down -> left -> down -> right -> down -> right.
The length of the path is 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12.
```

Exxample 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/31/maze1-2-grid.jpg)
```
Input: maze = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[1,1,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0]], start = [0,4], destination = [3,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way for the ball to stop at the destination. Notice that you can pass through the destination but you cannot stop there.

# Answer
这道题很有意思的一个条件是`球在碰到墙后才会转向`
### BFS
```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, maze: List[List[int]], start: List[int], destination: List[int]) -> int:
        ROWS, COLS = len(maze), len(maze[0])            # 获取矩阵大小
        queue = [(start[0], start[1])]                  # 构造队列，并将起始位置包含其中
                                                        # distance保存从起点到每个点的距离
        distance = [[float("inf")] * COLS for _ in range(ROWS)]
        distance[start[0]][start[1]] = 0

        while queue:
            i, j = queue.pop(0)
            for choice in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
                x, y, step = i + choice[0], j + choice[1], distance[i][j]
                while 0 <= x < ROWS and 0 <= y < COLS and maze[x][y] != 1:
                    x += choice[0]
                    y += choice[1]
                    step += 1                           # 继续前进，模拟小球的滚动过程

                x -= choice[0]
                y -= choice[1]

                if distance[x][y] > step:               # 如果起点到该点的距离比当前距离大
                    distance[x][y] = step               # 更新该距离，并将坐标加入队列
                    queue.append((x, y))                # 并将其坐标添加到队列中
        return distance[destination[0]][destination[1]] if distance[destination[0]][destination[1]] != float('inf') else -1
