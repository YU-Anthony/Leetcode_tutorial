# Problem
In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.
# Answer
熟悉 `graph` 的话，应该知道这是一道有向图题，法官就是满足`入度为 n - 1, 出度为0`的节点。

所以这道题的思路就是遍历所有的节点，找出`入度为 n - 1, 出度为0`的节点。

具体做法是：
- 遍历 trust, 对于 trust[i] `[a, b]`, 说明 `a 信任 b`, `a`的出度+1，`b`的入度+1
- 遍历所有的节点，找出`入度为 n - 1, 出度为0`的节点
```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        in_degree = [0] *(n + 1)
        out_degree = [0] *(n + 1)
        
        for a, b in trust:
            in_degree[b] += 1
            out_degree[a] += 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if in_degree[i] == n - 1 and out_degree[i] == 0:
                return i
        return -1
```
