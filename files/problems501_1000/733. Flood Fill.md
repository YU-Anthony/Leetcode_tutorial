# Question
An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and newColor. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with newColor.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

Example 1:

```bash
Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.
```

Example 2:
```bash
Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,2]]
```

# Answer
[这一篇题解](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/flood-fill/solution/python3-dfs-yu-bfs-liang-chong-fang-fa-san-chong-s/)讲的特别好！
```python
class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, newColor: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        if image[sr][sc] == newColor:
            return image
        
        queue,origin = [(sr,sc)],image[sr][sc]
        collections = {(-1,0),(1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)}
        while queue:
            point = queue[0]
            del queue[0]
            image[point[0]][point[1]]=newColor
            # 遍历当前 pixel 的四周
            for collection in collections:
                new_point = (point[0]+collection[0],point[1]+collection[1])
                # 在不超出边界的情况下找出需要做修改的 pixel 并加到队列里
                if 0<=new_point[0]< len(image) and 0<=new_point[1]< len(image[0]) and image[new_point[0]][new_point[1]]==origin:
                    queue.append((new_point[0],new_point[1]))

        return image
```
