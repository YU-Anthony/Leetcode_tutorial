# Problem
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

Example 1:
```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

Example 2:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

Example 3:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

Constraints
- 1 <= piles.length <= 104
- piles.length <= h <= 109
- 1 <= piles[i] <= 109

# Answer
这道题可以用`二分法`来解，但首先我们要明白为什么要用`二分法`。

首先从`暴力破解`开始， 我们从`k = 1`开始，遍历每堆`pile`，如果总时间超时，肯定是要`增加k`的，直到找到一个k使得总时间小于h。

那这个暴力搜索的过程其实就可以用`二分法`来改进。

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        
        l, r = 1, max(piles)
        
        while l <= r:
            m = l + (r - l) // 2
            time = 0
            for pile in piles:
                time += math.ceil(pile / m)
                # time += (pile - 1) // m + 1
            if time <= h:
                k = m # 更新 k 值
                r = m - 1
            else:
                l = m + 1
        return k
```
- TC: O(nlogm), n for the length of piles, m for the maximum number of piles
- SC: O(`)
