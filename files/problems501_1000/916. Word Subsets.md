`string`<br>
`Hash Table`
# Problem
You are given two string arrays words1 and words2.

A string b is a subset of string a if every letter in b occurs in a including multiplicity.

- For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior" but is not a subset of "world".

A string a from words1 is universal if for every string b in words2, b is a subset of a.

Return an array of all the universal strings in words1. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1
```
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
```

Example 2
```
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["l","e"]
Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
```
# Answer
We should get the frequency table of largest frequency of each letter of words in `B`. Then scan through words in `A` whose frequency of letters can cover the last table.

```python
class Solution:
    def wordSubsets(self, words1: List[str], words2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        freq = {}
        for word in words2:
            for ch in word:
                cnt = word.count(ch)
                if ch not in freq or cnt > freq[ch]:
                    freq[ch] = cnt
                    
        ans = set(words1)
        for word in words1:
            for ch in freq:
                if word.count(ch) < freq[ch]:
                    ans.remove(word)
                    break
        return ans
```
- TC: O(M + N), M 和 N 分别为 words1 和 words2 的长度
