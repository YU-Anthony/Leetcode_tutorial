# Problem
Given a list of strings words and a string pattern, return a list of words[i] that match pattern. You may return the answer in any order.

A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.

Example 1
```
Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.
```

Example 2
```
Input: words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```

Constraints
- 1 <= pattern.length <= 20
- 1 <= words.length <= 50
- words[i].length == pattern.length
- pattern and words[i] are lowercase English letters.
# Answer
In this method, we will use `hashtable` and `array`
1. We use `hashtable` to record the first index of each character in the word
2. We use `array` to store the arrangement rules of characters in the word

Based on the above instructions, we can change the words into specific code. For example, `arr` -> `011`, `aca` -> `010`. So, we just need to compare the code of each word with the code of pattern. Then we will find the answer
```python
class Solution:
    def findAndReplacePattern(self, words: List[str], pattern: str) -> List[str]:
        model = self.getModel(pattern)
        ans = []
        for word in words:
            if len(word) == len(pattern) and model == self.getModel(word):
                ans.append(word)
        return ans
    
    def getModel(self, word):
        res = {}
        ans = []
        for i, c in enumerate(word):
            if c not in res:
                res[c] = i
            ans.append(res[c])
        return ans
```
