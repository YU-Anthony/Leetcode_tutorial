## BFS
We could use `bfs` for this method. We need to keep in each cell of our queue with three elements: `city`-current city, `visited`-current number of visited cities, `price`-current price. A new city could be visited if it meets the following 3 conditions:
- Our current price is <= min_price
- visited < k + 1
- the current is not our destination yet

If we reached the destination city, we update the min_price we got so far.
但是这种方法好像会超时
```python
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        min_price = float("inf")
        
        for i, j, w in flights:
            graph[i].append([j, w])
        queue = deque([[src, 0, 0]])
        
        while queue:
            city, visited, price = queue.popleft()
            
            if price <= min_price and visited < k + 1 and city != dst:
                for ngh, p in graph[city]:
                    queue.append([ngh, visited + 1, price + p])
            
            if city == dst:
                min_price = min(min_price, price)
        return min_price if min_price != float("inf") else -1

```

还有种做法是这样的, 是 Dijkstra， 但是没有明白是为什么
```python
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in flights:
            graph[u].append([v, w])
            
        pq, seen = [(0, src, k + 1)], dict()
        while pq:
            d, u, s = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if u == dst:
                print(seen)
                return d
            
            if u in seen and seen[u] >= s:
                continue
            seen[u] = s
            
            if s:
                for v, w in graph[u]:
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (d + w, v, s - 1))  
        return -1
```
