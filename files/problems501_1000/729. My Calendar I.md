# Problem
You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendar class:

- MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.
- boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.

Example 1
```
Input
["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
Output
[null, true, false, true]

Explanation
MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.
myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.
```

Constraints
- 0 <= start < end <= 109
- At most 1000 calls will be made to book.

### Solution 1: Iterate All
```python
class MyCalendar:

    def __init__(self):
        self.calendar = set()

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        judge = True
        for i in self.calendar:
            if start >= i[1] or end <= i[0]:
                continue
            else:
                judge = False
                break
        if judge:
            self.calendar.add((start, end))
            return True
        else:
            return False
        


# Your MyCalendar object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyCalendar()
# param_1 = obj.book(start,end)
```

- SC: O(n)

### Solution 2: Binary Search
```python
class MyCalendar(object):

    def __init__(self):
        self.calendar = []

    def book(self, start, end):
        """
        :type start: int
        :type end: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        index = bisect.bisect_left(self.calendar, (start, end))
        # check if the start and the end are valid
        start_valid = (index == 0 or start >= self.calendar[index-1][1])
        end_valid = (index == len(self.calendar) or end <= self.calendar[index][0])
        
        if start_valid and end_valid:
            self.calendar.insert(index, (start, end))
            return True
        return False

        


# Your MyCalendar object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyCalendar()
# param_1 = obj.book(start,end)
```
