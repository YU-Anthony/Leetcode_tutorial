### Counting
We can check whether two numbers have the same digits by comparing the count of their digits. For example. `338` and `833` both have exactly two `3's` and one 8.

Since n is less and equals to 1^10 (one to the 10th power), so it could only be a power of 2 with 9 digits or less, we can just check whether n has the same digits as any possibilities.
```python
class Solution:
    def reorderedPowerOf2(self, n: int) -> bool:
        cnt = collections.Counter(str(n))
        
        return any(cnt == collections.Counter(str(1<<i)) for i in range(31))
```
- TC: O(logn^2 n), there are logn candidates and each comparison has O(logn) time complexity
- SC: O(logn)
