# Question

Given a string s, you can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string.

Return a list of all possible strings we could create. Return the output in any order.

Example 1:
```bash
Input: s = "a1b2"
Output: ["a1b2","a1B2","A1b2","A1B2"]
```

Example 2:
```bash
Input: s = "3z4"
Output: ["3z4","3Z4"]
```

# Answer

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCasePermutation(self, S: str) -> List[str]:
        res = [S] 
        for i,s in enumerate(S):
            # 判断是否为字母
            if s.isalpha():
                res.extend([s[:i]+s[i].swapcase()+s[i+1:] for s in res])
        return res
```

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCasePermutation(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        ans = []
        path = ""

        def helper(startIdx, path):
            if len(path) == len(s):
                ans.append(path[:])
                return
            for i in range(startIdx, len(s)):
                if s[i].isdigit():
                    helper(i + 1, path + s[i])
                else:
                    helper(i + 1, path + s[i].lower())
                    helper(i + 1, path + s[i].upper())
        helper(0, path)
        return ans
```

The time complexity of the above code is O(2^n), where n is the length of string s. This is because at each index, there are two possibilities (lowercase or uppercase), so there are 2^n total possibilities in the worst case.

The space complexity of the above code is O(n), where n is the length of string s. This is because at each level of the recursion, a new character is added to the path, which takes O(n) space. Additionally, there could be 2^n total combinations in the worst case, each of which takes O(n) space, resulting in a total space complexity of O(n * 2^n).
