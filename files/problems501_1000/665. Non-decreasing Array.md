# Problem
Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modify at most one element.
```

Constraints
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 104
- -105 <= nums[i] <= 105

# Answer
```python
class Solution(object):
    def checkPossibility(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] < nums[i - 1]:
                count += 1
                if i <= len(nums) - 2 and i >= 2:
                    if nums[i + 1] < nums[i - 1] and nums[i] < nums[i - 2]:
                        return False
            
            if count > 1:
                return False
        return True
```
