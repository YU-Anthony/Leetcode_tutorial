# Problem
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `√(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/closestplane1.jpg)
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

Example 2
```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
```

Constraints
- 1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
- -104 < xi, yi < 104

# Answer

### 直接排序
```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        points.sort(key = lambda x: x[0]**2 + x[1]**2)
        return points[:k]
```

- TC: O(nlogn)
- SC: O(logn), 排序所需要的额外空间为 O(logn)

### 最小堆
```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        for x, y in points:
            dist = abs(x)**2 + abs(y)**2
            res.append([dist, x, y])
        heapq.heapify(res)
        
        
        ans = []
        for _ in range(k):
            tmp = heapq.heappop(res)
            ans.append([tmp[1], tmp[2]])
        return ans
```
- TC: O(nlogn)
- SC: O(n)

可以再优化一下, 始终保持 heap 中只存 k 个元素，这样空间复杂度能降低到 `O(k)`
```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        heap = []
        for x, y in points:
            dist = - (x**2 + y**2)
            if len(heap) >= k:
                heapq.heappushpop(heap, (dist, x, y))
            else:
                heapq.heappush(heap, (dist, x, y))
        return [[x, y] for (_, x, y) in heap]
```

- TC: O(nlogk)
- SC: O(k)
