# Problem
Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

# Answer
Example 1
```
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
```

Example 2
```
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```

Constraints
- 1 <= words.length <= 500
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 10
- words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
- k is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]

# Answer
注意堆中 tuple 的排序规则
```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        res = defaultdict(int)
        for word in words:
            res[word] += 1
        heap = []
          
        for key, val in res.items():
            # 关于 tuple 的排序是先按照第一个键从小到大，再按照第二个键从小到大
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-val, key))

        return [heapq.heappop(heap)[1] for _ in range(k)]
```
