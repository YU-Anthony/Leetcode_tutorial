# Problem
You have a data structure of employee information, including the employee's unique ID, importance value, and direct subordinates' IDs.

You are given an array of employees employees where:

- employees[i].id is the ID of the ith employee.
- employees[i].importance is the importance value of the ith employee.
- employees[i].subordinates is a list of the IDs of the direct subordinates of the ith employee.

Given an integer id that represents an employee's ID, return the total importance value of this employee and all their direct and indirect subordinates.

Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/31/emp1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: employees = [[1,5,[2,3]],[2,3,[]],[3,3,[]]], id = 1
Output: 11
Explanation: Employee 1 has an importance value of 5 and has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3.
They both have an importance value of 3.
Thus, the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```
# Answer
Firstly, we can create tow hash set, one to store the importance of each employee, another to store the subordinates of each eployee. And we can use recursion to loop through each subordinates and add their importance to the final answer
```python
"""
# Definition for Employee.
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, id: int, importance: int, subordinates: List[int]):
        self.id = id
        self.importance = importance
        self.subordinates = subordinates
"""

class Solution:
    def getImportance(self, employees: List['Employee'], id: int) -> int:
        res = {}
        sub = {}
        
        def helper(id):
            importance = res[id]
            for sub_id in sub[id]:
                importance += helper(sub_id)
            return importance
        
        for employee in employees:
            res[employee.id] = employee.importance
            sub[employee.id] = employee.subordinates
        return helper(id)
```
