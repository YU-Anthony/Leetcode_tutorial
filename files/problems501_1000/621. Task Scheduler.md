# Problem
Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.

Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

Example 1
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
```

Example 2
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.
```

Example 3
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
Output: 16
Explanation: 
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A
```
# Answer
We should process the most frequent character at first. 其实也是用到了贪心的思想，先使用频数最大的。判断每一步可以使用的元素，如果有多个元素，则选择频数最大的，如果当前没有元素可以选择，则为 idle time。

那怎么判断是否有元素可以选择呢？我们在前面每一步使用每个元素的时候，记录当前元素下一次可以使用的时间点，这样我们就能知道每个时间点有哪些元素可以使用了。
```python
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        count = Counter(tasks)
        maxHeap = [-cnt for cnt in count.values()]
        heapq.heapify(maxHeap)
        
        time = 0
        q = deque()
        while maxHeap or q:
            time += 1
            
            if not maxHeap:
                pass
            else:
                cnt = 1 + heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
                if cnt != 0:
                    q.append([cnt, time + n])
            if q and q[0][1] == time:
                heapq.heappush(maxHeap, q.popleft()[0])
        return time
```
