# Problem
You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables where each string equations[i] is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "xi==yi" or "xi!=yi".Here, xi and yi are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or false otherwise.

Example 1
```
Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
```

Example 2
```
Input: equations = ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
```

# Answer
其实这是一道比较有意思的 UnionFind 的题目，我们首先对所有等式两边的元素建立通量，然后遍历所有不等式，如果这对元素已经在同一个通量里，就不可能不等(相矛盾)，所以我们可以返回 false。如果遍历完了都没有返回 false, 我们就返回 True.
```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parent = {}

    def find(self, x):
        parent = self.parent.get(x, x)
        if parent != x:
            parent = self.find(parent)
        return parent

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootx = self.find(x)
        rooty = self.find(y)
        self.parent[rootx] = rooty

    def is_connect(self, x, y):
        return self.find(x) == self.find(y)
        
class Solution:      
    def equationsPossible(self, equations: List[str]) -> bool:
        UF = UnionFind()
        for equation in equations:
            if equation[1] == '=':
                UF.union(equation[0], equation[3])
                
        for equation in equations:
            if equation[1] == "!":
                if UF.is_connect(equation[0], equation[3]):
                    return False
        return True
```
- TC: O(mlogn), m is the number of length, n is the number of vertices. Due to there are 26 vertices, so we could get the time complexity is O(m)
- SC: O(n), only a parent array of alphabet size needs an extra space here. So, we basically we could think the space complexity as O(1).
