# Problem

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example 1
```bash
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```

Example 2
```bash
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

# Answer
这道题其实挺简单的，但是为了练习双指针，我们再用其他的方法来做一下吧。

Actually this question is quite straightforward. The only trick is that we can have negative numbers in the input array. So, my solution is to use two-pointers method. Since the numbers at both ends can give us the largest square, we hence use two pointers : one points to the start of the array while anotehr points to the end of array. At any step, we get the bigger square, add it to the result array and move the corresponding pointers to the next or previous position. In the end, we could get the answer.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def sortedSquares(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        a,b=0,len(nums)-1
        i=b
        ans = [0]*(b+1)
        while i>=0:
            left = nums[a]*nums[a]
            right = nums[b]*nums[b]
            if left > right:
                ans[i] = left
                a+=1
            else:
                ans[i] = right
                b-=1
            i-=1
        return ans
```
