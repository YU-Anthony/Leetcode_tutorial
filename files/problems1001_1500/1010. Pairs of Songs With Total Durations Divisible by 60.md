# Problem
You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

Example 1
```
Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
```

Example 2
```
Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

# Answer
如果两个数之和能被60整除（他们之和取余为0），那么对两个数分别取余后，再相加之和还是可以被`60`整除

This problem is similar to `Two Sum` problem. We can find that 
```
(a + b) % 60 == 0 => (a % 60) + (b % 60) == 60
                  => (a % 60) == 60 - (b % 60)
```
So we can convert all `time` to their reminders firstly, and find the pair which `a' + b' == 60`. This is a typical `Two Sum` problem now. One edge case which we should keep in mind is `(a % 60) = 0 and (b % 60) = 0`. If `a % 60 == 0`, we need to find frequecy of `0` instead of `60 - (a % 60)`
```python
class Solution:
    def numPairsDivisibleBy60(self, time: List[int]) -> int:
        res = defaultdict(int)
        ans = 0
        
        for t in time:
            key = t % 60
            if key == 0:
                ans += res[0]
            else:
                ans += res[60 - key]
            res[key] += 1
        return ans
```
