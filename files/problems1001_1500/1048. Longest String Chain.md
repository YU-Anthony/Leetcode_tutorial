# Problem
You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.

- For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".

A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

Example 1:
```bash
Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].
```

Example 2:
```bash
Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5
Explanation: All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].
```

Example 3:
```
Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.
["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= words.length <= 1000
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 16
- words[i] only consists of lowercase English letters.

# Answer
 这道题我感觉本质上还是判断每个当前`word`是否有`substring`存在于记录中，并同时更新`string chain`的长度

```python3
class Solution:
    def longestStrChain(self, words):
        words.sort(key = len)
        res = defaultdict(int)
        max_len = 0
        
        for word in words:
            if word not in res:
                res[word] = 1
            for i in range(len(word)):
                cur = word[:i] + word[i + 1 :]
                if cur in res:
                    res[word] = max(res[word], res[cur] + 1)
            max_len = max(max_len, res[word])
        return max_len
```
