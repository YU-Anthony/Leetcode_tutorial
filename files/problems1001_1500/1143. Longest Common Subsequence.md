# Problem
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example 1:
```bash
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
- text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

# Answer
经典的`Dynamic programming`的解法


### Step 1: 确定状态
假设字符串 `text1` 和 `text2` 的长度分别为 m 和 n，创建 m + 1 行 n + 1 列的二维数组 dp，其中 dp[i][j] 表示 word1[0 : i] 和 word2[0: j]相同的「最长公共子序列」的长度。

### Step 2: 确定状态转移方程
若`text1[i - 1]`和`text2[j - 1]`字符相等，`dp[i][j]` 等于`dp[i - 1][j - 1]`，即`text1[0:i-1]` 和 `text2[0:j-1]` 的「最长公共子序列长度」+ 1,
若不等，则选取`dp[i][j - 1]`和`dp[i - 1][j]`中更大的「最长公共子序列长度」作为当前的「最长公共子序列长度」

### Step 3: 确定 basecase
- 当 i = 0 时，text1[0:i]为空，因此对于任意的`0<=j<=n`都有`dp[0][j] = 0`
- 当 j = 0 时， `dp[i][0] = 0`

```python3
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
        dp = [ [0]*(n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
        return dp[m][n]
```
