# Problem
# Answer
We frist creat an array to store the status of each character (invalid: True, valid: False), then create a stack to store the invalid left bracket.

We iterate through the character, for each left bracket, we first set it as invalid and add its index to the stack. 

When we meet right bracket, we first check the size of stack, 
    - if it is not None, it means could find a left bracket to pair with it. So, we pop one left bracket from stack and change the status of that left bracket to be False(valid)
    - if it is None, it means this right bracket occurs earlier than any left brackt. We make the status of this right bracket as True(valid)

In the end, we go through each character agian and only add the characters whose status is False.
```python
class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        bracketIdx = []
        invalidIndex = [False]*len(s)
        ans = ""
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '(':
                bracketIdx.append(i)
                invalidIndex[i] = True
            elif s[i] == ')':
                if len(bracketIdx) == 0:
                    invalidIndex[i] = True
                else:
                    invalidIndex[bracketIdx.pop()] = False
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if not invalidIndex[i]:
                ans += s[i]
        return ans
```
