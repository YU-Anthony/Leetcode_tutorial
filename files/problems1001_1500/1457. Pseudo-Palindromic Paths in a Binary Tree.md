# Problem
Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.

Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.

Example 1

```
Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]
Output: 2 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
```

Example 2

```
Input: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 1 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the green path [2,1,1], the path [2,1,3,1], and the path [2,1]. Among these paths only the green path is pseudo-palindromic since [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).
```

Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 9
# Answer
## DFS
The second `add` and `remove` is a textbook backtracking step, that is done to preserve the current path to different future paths. The second one restores the path to what it was in the node that originally pass down the call, so that when we backtrack to it, the path keeps it integrity at the current node.
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 0
            cur.remove(root.val) if root.val in cur else cur.add(root.val)
            res = 0
            if not root.left and not root.right and len(cur) <= 1:
                res += 1
            else:
                res += dfs(root.left) + dfs(root.right)
            cur.remove(root.val) if root.val in cur else cur.add(root.val)
            return res
        cur = set()
        return dfs(root)
