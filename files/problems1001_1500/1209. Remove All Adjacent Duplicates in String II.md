# Problem
You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

Example 1
```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
```

Example 2
```
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

Example 3
```
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
```
# Answer
## Stack
如果当前元素与栈顶元素相同则增加该元素个数，如果元素个数达到 `k` 则`pop`栈顶元素，
如果当前元素不等于栈顶元素，则直接将该元素加入栈并赋值为`1`
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        stack = []
        
        for c in s:
            if not stack or stack[-1][0] != c:
                stack.append([c, 1])
            elif stack[-1][1] + 1 < k:
                stack[-1][1] += 1
            else:
                stack.pop()
        
        ans = ""
        for c, n in stack:
            ans += c * n
        return ans
```

- SC: O(n)
