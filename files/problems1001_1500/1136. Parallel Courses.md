```python
class Solution:
    def minimumSemesters(self, n: int, relations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        graph = {i:[] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
        indegrees = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
        
        for u, v in relations:
            graph[u].append(v)
            indegrees[v] += 1
        
        queue = deque()
        for node in graph:
            if indegrees[node] == 0:
                queue.append(node)
        
        step = 0
        studied_crs = 0
        while queue:
            step += 1
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                studied_crs += 1
                node = queue.popleft()
                for child in graph[node]:
                    indegrees[child] -= 1
                    if indegrees[child] == 0:
                        queue.append(child)
        return step if studied_crs == n else -1
```
- TC: O(N + E), we spend O(N) to initialize the graph and spend O(E) to add edges since we need to iterate the relations
- SC: O(N + E)
