# Problem
You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:

- If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
- If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

Example 1
```
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.
```

Example 2
```
Input: stones = [1]
Output: 1
```

Constraints
- 1 <= stones.length <= 30
- 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
# Answer
```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones = [-s for s in stones]
        heapq.heapify(stones)
        
        while len(stones) > 1:
            y = heapq.heappop(stones)
            x = heapq.heappop(stones)
            diff = y - x
            if diff != 0:
                heapq.heappush(stones, diff)
        return -stones[0] if len(stones) != 0 else 0
