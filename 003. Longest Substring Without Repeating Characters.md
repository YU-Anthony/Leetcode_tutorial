# Question
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

# Answer
This is a typical sliding window problem. We can use the template of this problem. 
```
 初始化左边界 l = 0
 初始化返回值 ret = 最小值 or 最大值
 for r(右边界) in 可迭代对象:
    更新窗口内部信息
    while 根据题意进行调整:
        比较并更新 ret(收缩场景时)
        扩张或收缩窗口大小
    比较并更新 ret(扩张场景时)
 return ret
```
```python3
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        l,ret=0,0
        res=[]
        for r, val in enumerate(s):
            while val in res:
                l+=1
                res.pop(0)
            res.append(val)
            ret=max(ret,r-l+1)
        return ret              
```
